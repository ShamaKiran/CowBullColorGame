# CowBullColorGame
CowBullColourGame is an interactive color guessing game developed using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The objective of the game is to guess a sequence of four colors chosen randomly from a set of predefined colors (Red, Blue, Yellow, Green) within a limited number of tries.

Players can select from three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, which provide 10, 5, and 3 attempts respectively. For each guess, the game provides feedback on whether each color in the sequence is correct and in the correct position, correct but in the wrong position, or completely incorrect. The game continues until the player either guesses the correct sequence or exhausts their attempts.
